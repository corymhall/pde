# Personal Development Environment (pde)

This repo contains my dotfiles along with everything needed to setup my personal
development environment. It uses [Pulumi](https://www.pulumi.com/) to configure
my machine. I also created a custom [Pulumi
provider](https://github.com/corymhall/pulumi-provider-pde) which I use in this
repo.

## Up
